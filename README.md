## Rock Paper Scissors!

This is a simple rock paper scissor game project created as a requirement for The Odin Project. The goal is to test fundamental knowledge of javascript syntax and basic problem solving skills, as well as practice for logical statement and function creation. A simple UI was added after learning DOM manipulation to make the experience better for users.

The game is simple. The user plays against a computer (uses randomizer for the computer pick) and the first to get five(5) points wins! A display in the end is shown to display the winner, and to ask the player if the player wants to play another round.
